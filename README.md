# English-Greek-Dictionary

This project was created for academic purposes on the subject of 'Basic Programming Principles' at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

A project written in C language that translates words from Greek into English and vice versa. The program retains a dictionary stored in a text file, which contains for each Greek word the corresponding English one. A menu of options displayed to the user is listed below:

1. Insert Term
2. Edit Term
3. Delete Term
4. Translate Word
5. Translate Sentence
6. Exit  

When the user types a word that does not exist in the dictionary instead of the program displaying an error message, it should calculate the distance of the user's word from the words of the dictionary (according to Levenshtein distance) and display the three closest words to the one the user typed.
